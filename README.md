# EXCEED Prolific Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the EXCEED Prolific application, a study aimed at investigating code
understanding and error correction using Python code snippets and error messages. The frontend is built with Next.js and
React, providing a survey interface for participants to provide their experience with Python, answer MCQs, and
participate in code debugging tasks.

## üß© Stack Overview

- **TypeScript**
- **React** (with Next.js App Router)
- **Next.js** for SSR and routing
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Docker** for containerization (optional)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alemoraru/exceed-prolific-frontend.git
   cd exceed-prolific-frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server:**

## üìù Notes

- The frontend is designed to work with the EXCEED Prolific
  backend ([EXCEED Prolific Backend](https://github.com/amoraru/exceed-prolific-backend)).
- Error messages and code snippets are fetched from the backend.
- The survey flow includes consent, experience, MCQs, and code debugging tasks.
- Cheating detection and progress tracking are implemented client-side.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (optional, for containerized deployment)
- Backend API running and accessible (see backend README)
